## 📊 Data Flow Architecture

### Hierarchical Data Structure
```
Colleges (Faculties)
├── Statistics (departments, courses, students)
├── Departments[]
│   ├── Statistics (courses, students)
│   └── Courses[]
│       ├── Enrollment data
│       ├── Level information
│       └── Assignment status
```

### Assignment Management Flow
```
Unassigned Courses → [Drag & Drop] → Lecturer
Assigned Courses ← [Drag & Drop] ← Lecturer
```

### Graph Network Structure
```
Lecturer Node (Center)
├── Course Node 1
├── Course Node 2
├── Course Node 3
└── ...
```
